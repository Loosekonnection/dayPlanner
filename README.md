## Pseudo Code

*   The current day and date has to be dynamically apended to the header.
*   A mechnism to obtain the date and time is reuired.

    *   for this I will use Luxon.

*   hourly time slots are required with three columns:

    *   An hourly time slot (starting at 9am).
    *   A text input area to record user detail, task, meeting etc..
    *   A save button to store the text input in local storage.

*   The current time slot needs be idenfied with an individual color.
*   The past time slot will need to change to grey.
*   The future time slots will need to be green.
